# Collaboration Guidelines for GitHub

## Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository to your local machine, use:
```
git clone <repository-url>
```

## Creating a New Branch
To create and switch to a new branch for your feature or fix, use:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

## Making Changes
Edit the necessary files in your local repository using VS Code.

## Committing Changes
To stage all changes, use:
```
git add .
```
To commit the changes, use:
```
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

## Pushing Changes
To push your changes to the remote repository, use:
```
git push origin <branch-name>
```

## Pulling Changes

## Best Practices
- Always pull the latest changes before starting new work.
- Keep your commits small and focused.
